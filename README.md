<h1>-/+ Counter App</h1>

I realised this simple but effective counter app with a split interface, this choice give me the opportunity to create two large buttons. 
The left side to decrease the count and the right one to increase it. I differentiated them using red and blue color, this helps to click the correct button.

I've implemented other two functions:

- RESET button
- Memory Management

If the reset button is easy to understand, let me explain the memory management. 
It consist in the possibility to refresh or even close your tab without lose your count, that is possible becouse the app, whenever you update your count, save the new value.
